Logstash, Elasticsearch, Grafana

 __________      __________      _______________      _________

```

./fake-traffic - is for emulation of external traffic (each 2 seconds will be sent a new message in logstash)

./logstash-elastic-grafana - is for filter, storage of logs, and show it in Grafana


Just run this 2 dirs one after another and you will see the power of magic ðŸ˜Š

P.S. Before you will run docker compose, replace all placeholders (you can do it with `./replace.sh`)
